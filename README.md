The COVID project focused on assessing COVID-19's effects on different countries, specifically delving into the vaccination status in each nation.

Data Source:
The dataset was sourced from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.

A breakdown of how this was achieved:

1. **Project Goals**: The main objectives revolved around comprehending the global and national impact of COVID-19. This involved examining infection rates, survival rates, and their implications at both levels.

2. **Setup Process**:
   - **Step 1**: Gathering data from the source.
   - **Step 2**: Importing the collected data into SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio).
   - **Step 3**: Review the dataset.
   - **Step 4**: Perform calculations.

3. **Analysis Procedures**:
   - Calculating the probability of mortality due to COVID.
   - Identifying countries with the highest infection rates, total fatalities, and highest mortality rates.
   - Studying the global trends encompassing cases, fatalities, and mortality rates.
   - Evaluating the vaccination status across different countries.
   - Exploring the potential relationship between a country's vaccination status and its Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

Through these outlined steps, the project aimed to elucidate and analyze the profound impact of COVID across various nations, shedding light on the vaccination landscape and its potential correlations with economic indicators like GDP.
